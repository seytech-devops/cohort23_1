test: Evaluate conditional expression.
    
    Exits with a status of 0 (true) or 1 (false) depending on
    
    File operators:
    
      -a FILE        True if file exists.
      -b FILE        True if file is block special.
      -c FILE        True if file is character special.
      -d FILE        True if file is a directory.
      -e FILE        True if file exists.
      -f FILE        True if file exists and is a regular file.
      -g FILE        True if file is set-group-id.
      -h FILE        True if file is a symbolic link.
      -L FILE        True if file is a symbolic link.
      -k FILE        True if file has its sticky bit set.
      -p FILE        True if file is a named pipe.
      -r FILE        True if file is readable by you.
      -s FILE        True if file exists and is not empty.
      -S FILE        True if file is a socket.
      -t FD          True if FD is opened on a terminal.
      -u FILE        True if the file is set-user-id.
      -w FILE        True if the file is writable by you.
      -x FILE        True if the file is executable by you.
      -O FILE        True if the file is effectively owned by you.
      -G FILE        True if the file is effectively owned by your group.
      -N FILE        True if the file has been modified since it was last read.
    
      FILE1 -nt FILE2  True if file1 is newer than file2 (according to
                       modification date).
    
      FILE1 -ot FILE2  True if file1 is older than file2.
    
      FILE1 -ef FILE2  True if file1 is a hard link to file2.
    
    All file operators except -h and -L are acting on the target of a symbolic
    link, not on the symlink itself, if FILE is a symbolic link.
    
    String operators:
    
      -z STRING      True if string is empty.
    
      -n STRING
         STRING      True if string is not empty.
    
      STRING1 = STRING2
                     True if the strings are equal.
      STRING1 != STRING2
                     True if the strings are not equal.
      STRING1 < STRING2
                     True if STRING1 sorts before STRING2 lexicographically.
      STRING1 > STRING2
                     True if STRING1 sorts after STRING2 lexicographically.
    
    Other operators:
    
      -o OPTION      True if the shell option OPTION is enabled.
      -v VAR         True if the shell variable VAR is set.
      -R VAR         True if the shell variable VAR is set and is a name
                     reference.
      ! EXPR         True if expr is false.
      EXPR1 -a EXPR2 True if both expr1 AND expr2 are true.
      EXPR1 -o EXPR2 True if either expr1 OR expr2 is true.
    
      arg1 OP arg2   Arithmetic tests.  OP is one of 
                        -eq:    equal
                        -ne:    not-equal
                        -lt:    less-than
                        -le:    less-than-or-equal
                        -gt:    greater-than
                        -ge:    greater-than-or-equal
    
    Arithmetic binary operators return true if ARG1 is equal, not-equal,
    less-than, less-than-or-equal, greater-than, or greater-than-or-equal
    than ARG2.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns success if EXPR evaluates to true; fails if EXPR evaluates to
    false or an invalid argument is given.


    #######################

Argument	        Role
$0	              Reserves the function's name when defined in the terminal. When defined in a bash script, $0 returns the script's name and location.
$1, $2, etc.	    Corresponds to the argument's position after the function name.
$#	              Holds the count of positional arguments passed to the function.
$@ and $*	        Hold the positional arguments list and function the same when used this way.
"$@"	            Expands the list to separate strings. For example "$1", "$2", etc.
"$*"	            Expands the list into a single string, separating parameters with a space. For example "$1 $2" etc.
