    - Had to create a lot of python code and create python based image
- Harbor
    - When we create an Image for Demisto it was a python based, I had to publish into Harbor under our  demisto/application id.

    - Pull from there and deploy into Demisto, 
        - Dev, QA, Prod

## Monitoring

    - I  have created many diffent custom dahboards 
        - ccheck the incoming traffic 
        - check cpu amd memory usage
- Promethues monitor servers not in kube cluster
    - Monitors cluster and alerts if it fails.
    - Create to monitor custom Rabbitmq servers.

## How to setup Kube Cluster Via Ansible:
- You run ansible playbook taht calls many roles:
    - You have 8 servers:
        - Ansible must do the following:
            - configure 3 serevrs as a control plane
            - 5 servers as a worker node
        - How does it do?
            - Using invertories
        - Run kubeadm in ansible to install kubernetes cluster
        - Using heml in ansible I install promethues and grafana
        - Also install Vault and console via helm in ansible
    
    - Can you please provide some of the modules you used in Ansible:
        - helm
        - copy
        - file
        - dir
    - What is the difference between defualt and vars:
        - The value in vars will overwrite the one in default one

    - Difference between ansible collection vs roles
        - collection caontains multiple roles
        - roles contain one or multiple task


## Troubleshoot
- I found ssh conenction time out. By default it is set to 5 minutes 
    - /etc/ssh/sshd_config : 
    - When you set the ClientAliveInterval value in the SSH server configuration file (typically located at /etc/ssh/sshd_config), it enables a keep-alive mechanism to ensure that SSH connections remain active even when there is no activity.

- [Kubelet won't reconenct to Apiserver after NIC failure](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/87615)
    - We have kube cluster running on your on-prem data
        - Those run on Linux machines
        - Those are Virtual machines run in VMWare (Now, I use more like a OS Guess system)
            - VMWare admin privisoned a vm for you
                - 
    - 3 control plane (three different IPs)
        - HA 
            - HAproxy 
            - KeepAliveD
    - 5 worker node
    - You have received an alert from promethues
        - Kube cluster is down.
        - You login to cluster (UI - Rancher, LIke a LEN)
        - You start login the server (ssh)
            - He asked you said you login to server, how do you login, what do you mean by that?
            - The What do you do?
                - troubleshooting steps NOW:
                    - check ip (ifconfig -a)
                    - kubelet (check kubelet service)
                        - up and running
                    - check the logs
                        - you will see the issues
        - get the failure message and google it
            - I found a bug open agaent the kubernetes.
            - It was due to a version you guys used. 
            - Still didn't fix yet. This was a recent.
    - Solution maybe:
        - Data center has some issue with networking
            - Your VM NIC down for quick time

- [HTTP2](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/40201)
    - Switched the Data center, VMWare start getting failed (kubeadm setup cluster)
- Azure Application gateway needed for app that needs internet access
- everything else  is on kube cluster.
